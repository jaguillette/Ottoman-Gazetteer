This gazetteer is a transformation of tables in Tahir Sezen's *Osmanlı Yer Adları* (Ottoman Place Names), available [here](http://www.os-ar.com/osmanli_yer_isimleri.pdf) and many other places.

It uses the following fields:
1. **İdârî Birimin Yeni Harflerle Adı** The name of the administrative unit in the Roman alphabet. While many places have just one name here, others have two or more variants, each of which appears in its own field (named İdârî Birimin Yeni Harflerle Adı 2, 3, 4, or 5). The current name of the place is given in all caps in all caps.
2. **Eski Harflerle Adı** The name of the administrative unit in the Arabic alphabet. Only one name is given here, corresponding to the first entry of the various Romanized names.
3. **Unvan** This field describes the position that the place occupied in the Ottoman administative hierarchy. A complete dictionary of these terms appears below. In many cases, a year (or approximate year, or century) is given, corresponding to the date at which the place began to occupy its function. There are also often notes (from Sezen) associated with this particular place and position, which I've reproduced in the database.
4. **Bagli Olduğu Nahiye, Kaza, Sancak, Eyâlet veya Vilâyet** This field lists the superior administrative unit(s) to which the place in question belongs. I have broken each of these out into its own field, and they appear in sequence from subsidiary to superior.
