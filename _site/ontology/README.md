This is a very preliminary ontology. 

I am not sure that the geonames ontology is still maintained, but it provides a rich vocabulary, listed [here](http://www.geonames.org/statistics/total.html). I'm drawing on it for now. I need something to make the fundamental distinction between settlements and regions.

I'll add dates for the end and start of different regimes. Show that Vilayet succeeds Eyalet.

I'll eventually add various minor kinds of units (muhafizlik etc).
