# Ottoman-Gazetteer
Materials for the production of a historical gazetteer of the Ottoman empire.

Initial aims:

- a linkable database of Ottoman provinces, subprovinces, major cities, and other generally-agreed geospatial objects

## Progress
April 27, 2016: posted [tsv spreadsheet](https://github.com/whanley/Ottoman-Gazetteer/blob/master/data/Osmanli-yer-adalari.tsv) of 6411 adminsitrative units
